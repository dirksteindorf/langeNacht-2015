### Audio Output

Type your text at [FromText2Speech](http://fromtexttospeech.com/ "Free online Text To Speech service with natural sounding voices"), download the mp3-file and convert it with sox into a format, which sfml can use. For example into ogg-Vorbis:  

'sox source.mp3 dest.ogg'  

Place the ogg-file into the MIRA/res-folder and if necessary edit the filename in the main.cpp (MIRA/src/).
